# MasterProject
in file test1.ipynb timestamps of the new cycles start is stored in the 'bins'

## 12.06
Create 1 NN (dynamcis):
input: opti trap (initial pos, velocity, acc) pairwise compared to simulated by timestamps; output: measured particle position. Pass the whole sequence. Create simulations for 5 circles with different sizes using MATLAB + rotation.

## 15.06
Added rotation file jupyter and generated (360 files * 5 circle shapes)

## 19.06
Added traps rotation file jupyter and generated (360 files * 5 circle shapes)

Next steps:
- velocity, acceleration
- reform the files for the simulator? check if rotated files work correctly
